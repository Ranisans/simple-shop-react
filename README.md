The design was getting from [Junior-Frontend-Test-Designs](https://www.figma.com/file/MSyCAqVy1UgNap0pvqH6H3/Junior-Frontend-Test-Designs-Public?node-id=0%3A1) with some changes:
  - a product attributes shown only in cart and product page. Without a label on it, we don't understand what attribute it is
  - with the label, Cart overlay design shows too ugly
    - For example, iMac 2021 has attributes with labels "WITH USB 3 PORTS" and "TOUCH ID IN KEYBOARD" and variants "Yes" and "No".
